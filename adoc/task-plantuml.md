## PlantUML Exercise

Draw 3-7 connected 'things' in a PlantUML diagram 
of any type you want: class, sequence, activity, component, etc.

Besides the examples in this folder, use the documentation:

If your IDE cannot render .puml files (despite additional plugins), 
you can use the online editor: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml
